# ToDo-App-AAC
ToDo list app is a sample project of Android Architectural Component. 

This project is made by following:
1) MVVM
2) LiveData
3) Room

I have learnt TDD from [Mindorks Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.mindorks.com/) and [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud851/lessons/1a4a85e6-c457-4192-aaab-9fa4a1db959e/concepts/be8cf09a-bb35-4b8f-842c-7895a9c10c02) websites.
